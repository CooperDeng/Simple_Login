# Simple_Login
This is the repository for my simple login system personal project!
this simple system would allow the user to register for an account or log into the system using fstream operations.
There is an simple throw&catch at the end of the operation, which is meant to be throwing out errors when the input
by the user is detected not to be 1 or 2.
